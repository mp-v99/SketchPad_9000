ðŸš€ Introduction

Welcome to SketchPad 9000, a digital canvas that takes inspiration from the classic Etch-A-Sketch and sketchpad toys â€” but this time, it's all JavaScript, baby.

This is more than a toy. It's a battlefield for DOM manipulation practice. The grid, the hover magic, the reset button â€” everything is powered by vanilla JS, just the way The Odin Project intended. No libraries. No CSS Grid. No training wheels.

âœ¨ Features
A responsive 16x16 grid of divs, dynamically generated via JavaScript

Interactive drawing via hover effects

Flexbox-based layout (CSS Grid? Never heard of her)

A Reset/Resize button that rebuilds the grid on demand

Input validation to protect your browser from meltdown (max 100 per side)

Clean, readable code

Progressive round-by-round development: built first to work, then to shine

ðŸ’Ž Extra Credit:

ðŸŽ² Each square randomly changes its RGB color on hover

ðŸŒ‘ Every pass darkens a square by 10% until it's completely black

ðŸ§ª Tech Used
HTML

CSS (Flexbox only)

JavaScript (Vanilla â€” zero frameworks, 100% gains)
