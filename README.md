ðŸš€ Introduction

Welcome to SketchPad 9000, a digital canvas that takes inspiration from the classic Etch-A-Sketch and sketchpad toys â€” but this time, it's all JavaScript, baby.

This is more than a toy. It's a battlefield for DOM manipulation practice. The grid, the hover magic, the reset button â€” everything is powered by vanilla JS, just the way The Odin Project intended. No libraries. No CSS Grid. No training wheels.

âœ¨ Features

A responsive 16x16 grid of divs, dynamically generated via JavaScript

Interactive drawing via a custom draggin logic which consists of checking if mousedown is true to then allow for the cursor to draw in the grid while hovering

Flexbox-based layout (CSS Grid? Never heard of it)

A custom knob to resize the grid

A clear button to erase everything at once. 

Color buttons such as: 

    a small menu button that allows to pick any particular of the rainbow colors. 
    a black button to draw in black
    an eraser button
    a rainbow button to randomly draw different colors
    a shades button to darken a square by 10% until completely black  and then reset

To resize the grid, the course asks me to add a button on the top that sends a popup asking for the number of the squares. Honestly, I just found it so unappealing and boring and decided to build a knob by mixing an input range element and a response animation. 

Clean, readable code

Progressive round-by-round development: built first to work, then to shine

ðŸ§ª Tech Used

HTML

CSS (Flexbox only)

JavaScript (Vanilla â€” zero frameworks, 100% gains)
